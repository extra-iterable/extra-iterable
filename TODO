cycle? chunk? IN PROGRESS

Should cycle accept a start index parameter?
It would make sense to be able to start cycle
at a given start index (more generic).
cycle(x, i, n)

- fromRange
- fromFunction?

Rust interleave() looks like zip -> concat.

batching? coalesce? dedup?
Looks like a custom chunk function.
Can this be done with a reduce?

step(x, n) is a customized version of filter.

- set.compare using array.compare
- set.union using array.compare ...
- array.chunkAt
